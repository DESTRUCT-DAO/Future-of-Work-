# Future of Work

## Do-to-Earn platform. 

One of the main things that we want to build in **DESTRUCT DAO** is a bounty based do-to-earn platform, so that projects can easier get needed work done and so they can ease the workload and focus on the important things. 

## Why? 

As a 'green' project, I found it is VERY difficult to find people who are qualified and experienced in doing partical set of tasks. Usually, people are already preoccupied with something and don't have the time to do your thing, or you can't really understand whether or not a person is capable of completing the needed body of work. 

Hence: **Bounty System** 

## Vision 

Here is how it should work in our minds. There will be a board, which can be sorted based on projects, tasks, rewards, popularity and etc. On this board there are different tasks, that people can do to get the reward. 

Tasks at hand can be different: 

- Writing Twitter thread/post 
- Drawing Fan Art 
- Creating a character for the collection 
- Coding frontend/backend 
- Discord moderation 
- Designing merch 

Basically, whatever comes to mind. And for each of those tasks there will be a bounty. 

The bounty itself can be either paid via crypto or it can give some benefits to the winner. Also, we propose that there will be multiple placings for each bounty. 

Moreover, in the current situation, there aren't that many collaborations happening, which is why we had an **additional bounty** in mind for some of the tasks, so that project can ask people, who won to collaborate, so that they can make the best thing together for some additional winnings. 

## How it should work? 

As a user you login via Discord (or Mail) and connect your crypto Wallet. Then, when you start participation in some task and you account id is now in the pool for that task and if you win, the winnings are sent to your wallet. As for the project, you login, you create a track, you connect your wallet and send the money to the escrow. Ideally, everything should happen on-chain through the escrow account. You, as a project, select the winner (or you can make it a community vote) and his id get's the prize from the escrow account. 

## Payment 

Us, as the board, we get only the percentage from the bounties posted from both sides (project and user). But it's a flexible thing, cause we were thinking that participants that hold the NFT of the project either don't have to pay that fee, or get some additional benifits for participation. 

## Monetisation 

For projects: you can get work done easier and faster and better, without having to deal with the headache of searching for people yourself. 

For users: easier job find and reward system (even if you don't win any bounties). 

## Additional 

Honestly, it has and endless field of opportunities and we really want to build this system to better the Web3 and Job-finding experience in general. Plus it can be scaled really well.
